This is work in progress to create an orienteering style in [Mapbox Studio](https://www.mapbox.com/mapbox-studio/#darwin). Sample data are exported from [OCAD](http://ocad.com/en/) as shapefiles and reprojected in QGIS. Data were exported as points, lines, and polygons with buildings as a separate (top) layer.

Future items on the roadmap:
- add polygon pattern files
- add marker files for complex markers
- add line patterns
- color match

## Symbols

Numbers for all symbols match [ISOM 2000 specification](http://orienteering.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/International-Specification-for-Orienteering-Maps-2000_2.pdf) as closely as possible.
